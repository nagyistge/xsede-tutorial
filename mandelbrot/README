This is intended to be run from midway.

Please get this version of swift-trunk, before mods to submit scripts were made.

This was only tested locally on midway.

The assemble step depends on direct staging.

The swift.conf is setup such that the assemble to gif movie, is done on localhost
while the run_mandelbrot script is executed on the supported MPI sites.

The run_mandelbrot script requires 3 env variables to be set, which are passed via
the env. definition in the swift.conf, these variables are :

env.MACHINE: "midway"
env.MPI_APP_PATH: "/scratch/midway/yadunand/swift-tutorial/mandelbrot/bin/mandelbrot"
env.MPI_RANKS: "12"

Since MPI build on different machines differ, make your own installation on the sites,
and then point the MPI_APP_PATH at the right executable on the remote system, along
with setting up modules in the if:elif ladder selected by env.MACHINE in run_mandelbrot script.

Swan single rank runs works for me. THe mandelbrot code needs to be built by the default cc on the system.
Multiple ranks fail with an apsched error.

Stampede fails to run at all with MPI errors.
