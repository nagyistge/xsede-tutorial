Setting up Amazon EC2
---------------------

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Getting cloud resources on-demand from Amazon is now as simple as setting up an account and attaching a credit card.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and create an IAM user by following instructions
from http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html[Amazon's Setup Documentation].
From the documentation you would only need to do the following two steps:

1. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html#sign-up-for-aws[Sign up for AWS]

2. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html#create-an-iam-user[Create and IAM User]

NOTE: To create access keys, you must have permissions to perform the required
IAM actions. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingCredentials.html[Managing Credentials using IAM].

If you already have an account, here's the steps to get you IAM access keys:

1. Go to the IAM console.

2. From the navigation menu, click Users.

3. Select your IAM user name, or create a new one.

4. Click User Actions, and then click Manage Access Keys.

5. Click Create Access Key.
+
NOTE: Your keys will look something like this: +
Access key ID example    : AKIAIOSFODNN7*EXAMPLE* +
Secret access key example: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCY*EXAMPLEKEY* +
+

6. Click Download Credentials, and store the keys (a .csv file) in a secure location.

NOTE: Your secret key present in the credentials file will no longer be available
through the AWS Management Console; you will have the only copy. Keep it confidential
in order to protect your account.
